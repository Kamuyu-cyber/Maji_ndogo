**Revitalizing Maji Ndogo: A Data-Driven Approach to Addressing Water Scarcity**

---

### **Background**
Maji Ndogo, a fictional country, faces a severe water crisis that impacts the daily lives of its citizens. This project utilizes SQL to extract meaningful insights from extensive datasets, aiming to provide data-backed solutions to alleviate the crisis.

---

### **Project Scope**
The study unfolds across four stages, each progressively increasing in complexity, focusing on data exploration, analytical clustering, statistical auditing, and strategic planning. By the end, a comprehensive framework is developed to guide interventions in the country's water management.

---

### **Phase 1: Initial Data Investigation**
The first step involved understanding the dataset comprising **60,000 records** distributed across **eight key tables**:

- **Core Entities:** Employees, water sources, locations, visit logs, water quality assessments, and pollution data.
- **Metadata:** The data dictionary provided a reference to attribute definitions.

#### **Key Findings**
- **Water Source Distribution**: Five primary water source types were identified—household taps (functional and broken), wells, shared taps, and rivers.
- **Queue Times**: Shared taps had disproportionately long wait times, exceeding **500 minutes** in some cases, often serving over **3,000 people**.
- **Water Quality Concerns**: Survey data indicated potential inconsistencies, particularly where high-quality scores were assigned to revisited sources, contradicting protocol.
- **Pollution Anomalies**: A subset of well contamination records was misclassified, necessitating corrections to avoid health risks.

---

### **Phase 2: Advanced Data Analysis**
This phase leveraged SQL functions, including window functions, to uncover deeper insights:

#### **Findings**
1. **Population Reliance on Water Sources**:
   - **43%** of the population depended on shared taps, with thousands relying on a single source.
   - **31%** had home-based infrastructure, but nearly half of these systems were non-functional.
   - **18%** accessed wells, yet only **28%** of these were safe for consumption.
2. **Queue Dynamics**:
   - Peak congestion occurred on Saturdays and during morning/evening hours.
   - Wednesdays and Sundays had significantly lower wait times.

---

### **Phase 3: Data Integrity Audit**
Integrating an external auditors’ dataset, we validated the accuracy of surveyor records:

- **94% Accuracy Rate**: Most surveyor records aligned with auditor evaluations.
- **Surveyor Errors**: A group of **17 surveyors** displayed consistent inaccuracies, with four individuals exceeding the average error rate.
- **Potential Causes**: Recorded community feedback hinted at possible biases or misinterpretations affecting data collection.

---

### **Phase 4: Strategic Interventions**
Based on the insights gathered, targeted solutions were devised to optimize resource allocation:

#### **Action Plan**
1. **Prioritize High-Impact Fixes**:
   - **Shared taps**: Install additional taps where queue times exceed **30 minutes**.
   - **Wells**: Implement **UV and RO filtration** for biological contamination and **RO-only filtration** for chemical pollutants.
   - **Infrastructure Repairs**: Address broken household taps before expanding the network.
2. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Focus efforts in **rural areas**, where the majority of the issues are concentrated.
   - Prepare for logistical challenges, including material shortages and accessibility constraints.

#### **Implementation Strategy**
Using SQL, relevant datasets were prepared to guide engineering teams, ensuring efficient deployment of resources where they are needed most.

### **Conclusion**
Through meticulous SQL-driven analysis, this project highlights the power of data in tackling real-world issues. The findings offer a roadmap for Maji Ndogo’s leadership to take decisive actions, ensuring sustainable access to clean water for its citizens.
